## Introduction
This is my second year mini project in B.E. Information tech. programme.

This application is developed with `JAVA SWING for GUI` and linked with `MySQL database` at backend. Data manipulation and validation is done with `JAVA` programming language.

College Management System helps in daily chores of college such as common noticeboard, student/teacher details, Student result analysis etc.

By this application the management/availability of student result & details would be handy to the management authority, any notices can be conveyed
to the students through common noticeboard, result of students is stored in database according to the year of study.
Provisions are made to view the result of passed out batches also.
